The game runs a cycle by first computing the movement of every object
[viz](https://patrickyoussef.com/blog/nbody/).

Then, using a modified version of
[rvemu](https://github.com/d0iasm/rvemu) to run a set number of
instructions. Map spacecraft systems into the memory space.  Map common
functions into the address space, and (maybe?) handle them special in
the emulator such that they incure a reduced instruction count.

In addition to memory-mapped io, there is a section of memory that will
be saved and reloaded each run. All other memory and registeres are
reset.

The game can be interacted with via a shell accessible via ssh. New
programs can be uploaded via sftp.
