Hardware Modules show up as USB devices:
.... or we'll just use a dumb text protocol because it's a lot easier to
get that working without modifying qemu or reverse engineering usbredir

  All USB Devices MUST report the following USB Descriptor Fields:
    idVendor  = 1209 Generic
    idProduct =	0001 pid.codes Test PID
    iManufacturer
    iProduct
    iSerial     (This will be filled in by the game when it installs the module)
